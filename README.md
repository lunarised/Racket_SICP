# SICP Learning

## Goals
- [ ] Get as far as I can through SICP before December 1st 2021
- [ ] Make sure I can understand every chapter before  I move onto the next one
- [ ] Aim to find ways to transfer knowledge obtained from SICP into LCL and other projects I'm working on
- [ ] Aim to better understand the fundimentals of compilation, functional programming and data structures at a low level
- [ ] Write a summary of each chapter that can be understood by someone else who hasn't read the book

## Why SCIP

Scip is a programming book that has come recommended 
by many people over the years, and is still in 2021 
regarded as one of the most important books to read 
as a developer. With functional programming making a
comeback, through avenues like Javascript, and Go, and
with languages such as Haskell and Erlang growing in 
popularity, It seems important to understand FP at a 
fundimental level now to prepare for the inevitable 
flood of folds

## Why not do the exercises in another language, say... Rust?

While Rust has some nice functional elements,
specifically the type system, I figured that the
course is going to be hard enough as it is! I haven't
done much purely functional stuff before and I think 
sticking with the language they write with is best

### Then why Racket?
Racket is a more modern dialect of LISP than Scheme
(which is the dialect that the book is written for)
so it should be easier for me to run the code (MIT
Scheme is getting harder to install reliably!!!)
Racket also has the sicp library which will recreate
scheme as it was intended to be used in the book, 
meaning it is likely all the books code shoudl run
happily
